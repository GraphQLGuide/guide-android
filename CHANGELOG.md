# Changelog
All notable changes will be documented in this file.

This file applies to the app that is created in Chapter 10 of the bookâ€”so the numbered step branches, not `master` ([more info](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-android#chapter-10-android)).

Releases are done with tags in the form `[step]_[version]`, so for instance step `4` of version `1.0.0` is `4_1.0.0`, located here: 

[/GraphQLGuide/guide-android/releases/tag/4_1.0.0](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-android/releases/tag/4_1.0.0)
